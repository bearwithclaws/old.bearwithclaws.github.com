title: "Tron + Jekyll = ?"

<span>December 2010</span>
Absolutely enjoyed *Tron: Legacy* yesterday.

I've been wanting to create a new blog theme on [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) for a while. *Tron* gave me the inspiration. Then I came across this interesting CSS framework called [LESS](http://lessframework.com). A couple of hours of creative procrastination later, here it is.

It's still very incomplete though - missing many core blog functionalities like RSS feed and comment. I've also imported a couple of posts from my [current blog](http://bearwithclaws.com) so it won't look empty. And, [the source is right here](https://github.com/bearwithclaws/bearwithclaws.github.com).
